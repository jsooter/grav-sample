## [Express Install](express)

Simply boot from our install disk image and it will automatically install CentOS 7, Docker and required dependencies. The Replicated installer and GitPrime Enterprise will be copied from disk so there is nothing to download.

## [AWS Install](aws)

Our AWS Machine Image is based on the high performance CentOS 7 image that Chef produces. Docker is pre-installed which really speeds up the GitPrime installation process. GitPrime and Replicated files are already there so there is nothing to download.

## [Manual Install](manual)

Installing GitPrime Enterprise is an easy process.  However, it does have a number of steps and requirements that you must complete in order.
